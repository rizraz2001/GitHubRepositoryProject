## Project requirments :
This project made based on .NET Framework 4.6.1 and MVC5.

You just have to open GitHubRepositoryTool.sln on the main folder with visual studio 
and you can run the project right away.   (I ran this project on visual studio 2017)

When you run the website you have two tabs in the navbar : GitHub Search Tool  , Bookmarks.

* GitHub Search Tool is the search area for github repository. users can search any repository as they want 
and can bookmark them on the bookmark button below each repository picture.
you can see notification in top right of the windows if the operation succeed or not.

* Bookmarks page is for viewing all the user's bookmarks repository that the user saved.

External resources (from nuget packages):
Autofac mvc - for dependency injection in the project.
Nlog - for logging the the actions.

If there is any question you can ask me any time.
